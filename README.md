# COMP0035 Group coursework

The group coursework specification on Moodle lists a number of formats that you can use to present your work.

One of those options is to present your work as a static website using Flask.

This format allows the groups that want to try this to get a little experience with Flask before COMP0034.

You are not marked on the quality of the web app, only on the information it contains.

Feel free to copy and adapt this code for your group.

Do not reply on the pages in this repo as a checklist for what needs to be included however. Make sure you carefully read the spec on Moodle which states what needs to be included.
